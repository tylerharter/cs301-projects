# Files involved:

The carssample.json only contains data of 3 cars. We recommend you use this file to develop your code.

The file “cars.json” has the actual data. This should be used to test your code.

Here is a sample structure of a single car data from the json file:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "Performance": {
      "Mileage": {
        "City mpg": "18",
        "Highway_mpg": "25"
      },
      "Horsepower": "250"
    },
    "Build": {
      "Make": "Audi",
      "Model": "Audi A3",
      "Year": "2009"
    },
    "Config": {
      "Transmission": {
        "Type": "Automatic",
        "Driveline": "2009",
        "Classification": "6 Speed Automatic Select Shift"
      },
      "Engine_Type": "Audi 3.2L 6 cylinder 250hp 236ft-lbs",
      "Dimensions": {
        "Length": "143"
      },
      "Height": "140"
    },
    "Hybrid": "False"
  }
}

```

The file test.txt contains data for the test.py file to grade your submission. Download this file in the same project folder.


## 1: Reading the json data

The first step of the assignment is to read the json file and load it into our program. Let us write a function to do this.

### 1.1 The `read_json` function:
>inputs to this function: 
>
> *json_filename* : a string which represents the name of the json file

To load a json data you will use json.loads.
This function should return a dictionary that you obtain when you load the json data.

Note: The process args function has been coded for you in the provided main.py. The function handles commandline arguments and calls the functions based on the commands. For this assignment no major modification of process_args() is necessary, except to connect the output of the functions you code to the respective variables.

You can test your code from terminal:
>python main.py carssample.json read_json

```
[('1', {'Performance': {'Mileage': {'City mpg': '18', 'Highway_mpg': '25'}, 'Horsepower': '250'}, 'Build': {'Make': 'Audi', 'Model': 'Audi A3', 'Year': '2009'}, 'Config': {'Transmission':
{'Type': 'Automatic', 'Driveline': '2009', 'Classification': '6 Speed Automatic Select Shift'}, 'Engine_Type': 'Audi 3.2L 6 cylinder 250hp 236ft-lbs', 'Dimensions': {'Length': '143'}, 'Hei
ght': '140'}, 'Hybrid': 'False'}), ('2', {'Performance': {'Mileage': {'City mpg': '22', 'Highway_mpg': '28'}, 'Horsepower': '200'}, 'Build': {'Make': 'Audi', 'Model': 'Audi A3', 'Year': '2
009'}, 'Config': {'Transmission': {'Type': 'Automatic', 'Driveline': '2009', 'Classification': '6 Speed Automatic Select Shift'}, 'Engine_Type': 'Audi 2.0L 4 cylinder 200 hp 207 ft-lbs Tur
bo', 'Dimensions': {'Length': '143'}, 'Height': '140'}, 'Hybrid': 'False'}), ('3', {'Performance': {'Mileage': {'City mpg': '21', 'Highway_mpg': '30'}, 'Horsepower': '200'}, 'Build': {'Mak
e': 'Audi', 'Model': 'Audi A3', 'Year': '2009'}, 'Config': {'Transmission': {'Type': 'Manual', 'Driveline': '2009', 'Classification': '6 Speed Manual'}, 'Engine_Type': 'Audi 2.0L 4 cylinde
r 200 hp 207 ft-lbs Turbo', 'Dimensions': {'Length': '143'}, 'Height': '140'}, 'Hybrid': 'False'})]
```
*If everything until here is correct, your score from test.py should be 10%.*

### 1.2: The `get_value` function: 
In the next step we need to create car objects. In order to do so  we need to first have a mechanism to retrieve specific information from the json data.Let us write a function that will help us find the value for the given field in the json_data. We will use **recursion** for this function. 

>inputs to this function: 
>
>car\_data : a dictionary containing information of  a particular car.
>
>field: The key that we are searching for.

Write a `recursive` function that would find the value for a given key in the json data and return that value.

>Note: There are multiple ways of coding this function that will cause the test to pass, however you should ONLY implement a RECURSIVE solution.
>
>python main.py cars.json read_json

*If everything until here is correct, your score from test.py should be 50%.*


## 2: namedtuples

We will now learn to quickly load json data as namedtuple objects.

### 2.1 The `make_namedtuple_list` function: 

Now we write a function that would create a list of namedtuple objects for all the cars in the json file. Here we will go through all car entries in the dictionary, create a namedtuple object for each of them. For this you can should have the following fields as your class members:'Id', 'Make', 'Model', 'Year', 'Transmission'.
> Note: They keys of the dictionary will now become the *Id* field in your namedtuple. The values of Make,Model,Year and Transmission can be obtained by calling the `get_value` function.

You can pull out the values for these fields from the json data by calling the getValue function you coded earlier.

>inputs to this function: 
>
> json_data: The dictionary containing the data of all the cars

This function will return a list of namedtuple objects for all cars.To run this function use:

>python main.py cars.json makelist

*If everything until here is correct, your score from test.py should be 70%.*


### 2.2 The `create_filter` function: 

This function will help us extract data from the namedtuple list of objects. Data is extracted based on some filtering condition.

>inputs to this function: 
>
>car_list: list of namedtuple objects
>
>filtering_criteria: a dictionary with conditions based on which filtering needs to be done.

The function will go through the list of all json data and select the ones that match all of the given criteria and add that into a list. The new list with the filtered objects is returned.

Here is a sample:
>python main.py  cars.json filter {\\\"Make\\\":\\\"Acura\\\"}
>
>Note:When passing a dictionary as a command line argument please take care to escape quotes with backslashes.

```python
Output:
[Car(Id='13', Make='Acura', Model='Acura TL', Year='2012', Transmission={'Type': 'Automatic', 'Driveline': '2012', 'Classification': '6 Speed Automatic Select Shift'}), Car(Id='14', Make='Acura', Model='Acura TL', Year='2012', Transmission={'Type': 'Automatic', 'Driveline': '2012', 'Classification': '6 Speed Automatic Select Shift'})]


```
*If everything until here is correct, your score from test.py should be 100%.*
