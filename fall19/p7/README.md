# Project 7: Fédération Internationale de Football Association

## Corrections

* Oct 18: test.py is updated. Please re-download it.

## Intro

Let's Play Fifa19, Python style!  In this project, you will get more
practice with lists and start using dictionaries.  Start by
downloading `test.py` and `Fifa19.csv` (which was adapted from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19)).  This dataset is too large to
preview on GitHub (>17K rows), but you can view the
[raw version](https://github.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/raw/master/fall19/p7/Fifa19.csv)
or using a program such as [Excel](https://github.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/blob/master/fall19/p7/excel.md).
You can also preview an example with 100 rows [here](https://github.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/blob/master/fall19/p7/preview.csv).
For this project, you'll create a new `main.ipynb` and answer
questions in the usual format.

## The Data

Try to familarize yourself with the data before starting the
analysis. We have players belonging to a wide range of nationalities
and clubs in Fifa19. As you can see the data includes their
weekly wages, in Euros (yes, wages are per week!), net worth of the
player (in Euros) and the performace rating (score out of 100). For
instance, the player named "Neymar" is associated with Brazil, is
signed up by club "Paris Saint-Germain", and is paid a weekly wage of '€290K'
(290000 Euros).

To ingest the data to your notebook, paste the following in an early cell:

```python
import csv

fifa_file = open('Fifa19.csv', encoding='utf-8')
file_reader = csv.reader(fifa_file)
player_data = list(file_reader)
fifa_file.close()
header = player_data[0]
player_data = player_data[1:]
for row in player_data:
    for idx in [2,4]:
        row[idx] = float(row[idx])
```

Consider peeking at the first few rows:
```python
print(header)
for row in player_data[:5]:
    print(row)
```

It's up to you to write any functions that will make it more
convenient to access this data.

## Let's Start!

#### Question 1: what is the name of the oldest player?

#### Question 2: what is the name of the highest-paid player?

If two players are paid the same, break the tie in favor of whoever
appears first in the dataset.

#### Question 3: what is the name of the highest value player?

#### Question 4: what club is that player(in above q3) in?

---

Complete the following function in your notebook:

```python
def get_column(col_name):
    pass # replace this
```

The function extracts an entire column from `player_data` to a list, which
it returns.  For example, imagine `player_data` contained this:

```python
[
    ["a", "b", "c"],
    ["d", "e", "f"],
    ["g", "h", "i"]
]
```

And `header` contains this:

```python
["X", "Y", "Z"],
```

Then column "X" is `["a", "d", "g"]`, column "Y" is `["b", "e", "h"]`, and
column "Z" is `["c", "f", "i"]`.  A call to `get_column("Y")` should
therefore return `["b", "e", "h"]`, and so on.

----

#### Question 5: what are the first five nationalities listed in the dataset?

Use `get_column`, then take a slice from the list that is returned to you.

#### Question 6: which five names are alphabetically first in the dataset?

By alphabetically, we mean according to Python (e.g., it is true that
`"B" < "a"`), so don't use the `lower` method or anything.

Don't deduplicate names in this output in the case that multiple
players have the same name.

#### Question 7: what is the average value?

#### Question 8: what is the average age?

---

Define a function `player_count` that takes a parameter, `country`,
and counts the number of players belonging to that country. This
function will be useful for the questions that follow.

---

#### Question 9: how many players have Portugal as their nationality?

#### Question 10: how many players have Brazil as their nationality?

#### Question 11: which country has the most players participating in FIFA19?

The `player_count` function can be useful here.

Hint 1: Make sure you aren't calling `player_count` more times than
necessary.  If you're not careful, the code will be very slow to
execute!

Hint 2: Mutiple ways to implement your code. Try to find the best way!

----

Define a function `player_to_dict` that takes a parameter,
`player_id`, and returns a dict containing all the information about
the player that matches.  Find the player row by matching `player_id`
to the `Id` column in the data.

---

#### Question 12: what are the stats for the player with `Id` equal to 20801?

Use your `player_to_dict` function.  The output should be a dictionary
like this:

```python
{'Id': '20801',
 'Name': 'Cristiano Ronaldo',
 'Age': 33.0,
 'Nationality': 'Portugal',
 'Overall': 94.0,
 'Club': 'Juventus',
 'Value': '€77M',
 'Wage': '€405K',
 'Preferred Foot': 'Right',
 'Jersey Number': '7',
 'Height': "6'2",
 'Weight': '183lbs'}
```

#### Question 13: what are the stats for the player with `Id` equal to 190871?

#### Question 14: what are the stats for the player with `Id` equal to 158023?

#### Question 15: what are the stats for the player with `Id` equal to 192985?

#### Question 16: how many players are there per nationality?

Answer in the form of a dictionary where the key is the nationality
and the value is the number of players for that nationality.

```python
{'Argentina': 937,
 'Portugal': 322,
 'Brazil': 827,
 'Spain': 1072,
 'Belgium': 260,
 ...
}
```

#### Question 17: how many players for each Jersey Number?

Jersey Number should be a string (don't convert it).  In 60 cases, the
Jersey Number is the empty string.  Your dictionary should include
this.

----

For the following questions, your lab work will be especially useful.

#### Question 18: what is the average player score (represented by the `overall` column) per Jersey Number?

Answer with a dict, mapping Jersey Number to average score.

#### Question 19: which Jersey Number has highest average overall?

#### Question 20: which club has highest average wage?
